# SocialEngineSpeech
Introduction about the idea.
Our project want to create social egnine for blind people. We understand that it's very hard for them to text to login, redirect page, see new feed and post new status. In our plugin, they just say comments and the system will do it for them.
We have 3 pages.
# Index page.
User open the landing page, they will hear the sentences "Welcome ... to social engine page". When they say "one", they will be redirected to page for new feeds. in the otherwise, they will be redirected to page for new post to post new status. To record the speech and translate speech to text to let machine understanding, we use this function.

# Newsfeed page
In the newsfeed page, users can listen the stories of their friends in 2 days nearly. We also show the post and comments following this post.

# Newpost page
In the newspost, blind people can not text something to post their status. From this idea, we let them say something and the system will translate speech to text and post status for them.
